# Q: Why vote every *n hours*?
# A: This bot votes every *n hours* (e.g., every 2.4 hours depending on how the bot is configured) because that is the exact amount of time it takes to recharge its voting power.

# Q: What happens if the transfer is sent just before payout?
# A: No upvote will happen in that case.  The blockchain does not allow upvotes 12 hours before payout.

# Q: Can voting only be done on posts or can comments work as well?
# A: Both posts and comments are acceptable.

# Q: What happens when 2 different accounts vote on the same post?
# A: Any transfers by any accounts to the same post within the same timeframe will *try* to stack (combine) into one bid.  Please note, the bot cannot stack bids if a vote has already been cast.

# Q: Can I get a refund if I don't get an upvote?
# A: The refund policy is up to the bot operator.

# Q: Can Dr. Otto be used for downvotes?
# A: Yes, the bot operator can configure either upvotes or downvotes.

# Q: Is there a configuration option for setting a maximum bid?
# A: No.
